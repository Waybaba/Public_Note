# Public_Note

This is a repository for some personal notes of mine when I am study. 

I built the repository for several reasons.

- I want be able to get access to my notes when using different devices.
- I would like to share what I learn with others and this is a fantastic way.
- This help me to practice English writing skill.
- Organizing these things makes feel great.
- MARKDOWN is a very geek and extremely pretty. And it makes it easy to transfer them to my website.

### What are these notes about ?

I major in **computer science** and **electronical engineering**, so that most things of this repo are about ...(you know, something for nerds)

### How these notes organized?

- **Pro-language** : all the things related to the language itself such as the basic grammar, file I/O, etc. 
- **Deep_learning** : some documents or related codes.
- **...** :
- **Quick/Others** : the pages which I am working on and have not be classified stay outside. ( always taking care of the classification job will break my thoughts, so that I am used to classify them when I finish them)
